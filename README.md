## Title:

Netflix Content Analysis and Visualization Dashboard (Tableau)

## Executive Summary:

This project analyzes the Netflix content catalog using Tableau to uncover patterns in content distribution, genres, ratings, geographic availability, and release trends. The dashboard provides an interactive visual exploration of movies and TV shows across different countries and time periods.

The goal of the project is to transform raw dataset records into meaningful insights that explain how Netflix’s content strategy evolved over time and what types of content dominate the platform.

## Business Problem:
Streaming platforms rely heavily on understanding viewer preferences and content distribution to guide acquisition and production strategies. However, raw catalog data alone does not clearly reveal:
- Which genres dominate the platform
- Whether Netflix focuses more on movies or TV shows
- Geographic content concentration
- Growth trends in content production
- Audience rating targeting (kids vs adults)

This project answers:

**_How has Netflix structured its content library and what does it reveal about its platform strategy?_**
